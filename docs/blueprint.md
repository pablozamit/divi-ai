## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#663399) to evoke a sense of innovation and creativity. Indigo combines the calm stability of blue and the fierce energy of red.
- Background color: Light Lavender (#E6E6FA), a desaturated variant of the primary color. Provides a soft, non-intrusive backdrop that maintains a visual connection to the primary color.
- Accent color: Electric Violet (#8F00FF), an analogous color to indigo. This vivid purple adds a dynamic contrast, drawing attention to key UI elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern and neutral appearance.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to complement the modern sans-serif typography and maintain a clean aesthetic.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to ensure readability and a professional appearance. Prioritize clear information hierarchy to guide the user through the design process.
- Incorporate subtle, non-intrusive animations to enhance user experience. For example, a gentle fade-in effect for generated elements or a smooth transition between prompts in the history panel.
